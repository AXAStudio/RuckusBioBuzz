     * demand by however far apart the two directions were. On a nearly square chassis the
     * rotation-only directions are +-43.5 / +-136.5 degrees, which is why the symptom reads as
     * "snapping to 45 degrees".
     *
     * <p>A smoothstep taper makes the demand direction continuous through the wall: the term
     * shrinks to nothing as the input approaches zero, so the demand migrates toward the other
     * term's direction instead of jumping to it. Value and slope both match at the band edge.

     * the input jumps - a stick released in one loop still swings the demand ~90 degrees. This
     * bounds the rate directly, and the bound is free: the measured pod slew is 214 deg/s
     * (184-259), so a demand moving faster than that is asking for travel the hardware cannot
     * deliver and only guarantees a saturated, lagging pod. A 90 degree change now takes 420 ms
     * of demand travel against the 421 ms of gross travel the pod measured for the same step.
     *
     * <p>Simulated over mydrive-001 (51.3 s of real driving, the recorded commands replayed
     * through both mixers): physical consecutive-loop demand change p90 19.8 -> 13.2 deg, jumps
     * over 15 deg 2.9/s -> 0.9/s, demand reversals 4.25 -> 3.47/s. 300 deg/s was tried first and
     * is worse at this loop rate - it spreads one big jump into several 19 deg steps and the
     * count of violations goes UP.
     *
     * <p>Note what the limiter cannot do: it is a RATE, so a slow loop still turns it into a big
     * step. 53% of the jumps that survive it in simulation happen on loops longer than 70 ms
     * (= 15 deg at 214 deg/s). Criterion 1 is therefore a loop-rate criterion as much as a mixer
     * one; at 50 Hz true with a 25 ms p99 the same limit permits 5.4 deg per loop.
     *
     * <p>Applied on the shortest-angle difference so it never sends a pod the long way round, and
     * skipped entirely past a quarter turn, where the pod flips and reverses the drive rather
     * than rotating - rate-limiting a flip would force a real 180 degree sweep with the drive
     * pointing the wrong way throughout.
