    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // TURN GAINS: retuned 2026-08-13 on the FTC game tiles after a pod repair and lubrication
    // of all four steering paths. Still NOT validated on a drained battery (criterion 12).
    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //
    // Everything below the 2026-08-12 block was measured before the mechanical work and no
    // longer describes this robot's friction. Kept because the negative results are still
    // valid and re-running them would cost days.
    //
    // Post-lube retune, all on the tiles at 12.9-13.6 V, randomised and interleaved:
    //
    //   kD: 0.022 confirmed. At kS 0.050, raising kD made things worse, not better -
    //       4/31 loose at 0.022, 7/30 at 0.030, 24/32 at 0.040. Damping does not buy back
    //       the wide mode.
    //   kS: 0.035 confirmed against 0.050 at n=60/53, Fisher exact p=0.025 - 1.7% loose
    //       against 13.2%, worst peak-to-peak 7.98 deg against 47.67. This REVERSES the
    //       pre-lube result where 0.045 beat 0.035 on the same tiles. The story is
    //       consistent: lubrication cut kinetic friction, so a kS sized to static breakaway
    //       (measured 0.050 on tiles) now overdrives the pod once it is moving. kS wants to
    //       track the kinetic regime, which is why the measured breakaway is the wrong target.
    //   kP: 0.200 -> 0.320. Residual falls monotonically and unambiguously across 534
    //       pod-runs: 3.24 / 2.64 / 1.86 / 1.09 deg mean at kP 0.200 / 0.230 / 0.260 / 0.320.
    //
    // The reason kP went UP rather than down, which is the opposite of the usual instinct:
    // large excursions (>15 deg post-settle peak-to-peak) occur at EVERY kP tested - 8 out of
    // 534 pod-runs overall, including one 30.7 deg event at kP 0.200 and a 43.4 deg event at
    // 0.230. Their rate does not separate by kP (0.5 / 1.0 / 2.4 / 3.3 percent, all four 95%
    // intervals overlapping). Backing kP off therefore buys no measurable protection while
    // costing the one criterion still being missed. The point estimates do trend upward, so
    // if more data ever separates them this decision should be revisited.
    //
    // Also measured post-lube and worth keeping:
    //   - Breakaway is 0.050 on tiles, 0.030 off the ground, uniform across all four pods
    //     (it was 0.05/0.07/0.06/0.05 before the mechanical work). The pod-to-pod spread is
    //     gone; the surface difference is not.
    //   - No backlash after the repair. Directional dead zone 0.05-0.45 deg, nothing
    //     significant on any pod, so criteria 5 and 6 remain mechanically unblocked.
    //   - Servo current at breakaway is under ~1% of the 3300 mA stall figure (Axon MINI+,
    //     interpolated to the 5 V rail). Torque headroom is large and is not the constraint.
    //
    // Committed because they are a large, measured improvement on what shipped, not because they
    // are finished. Randomised interleaved A/B against the previous gains, same battery, 40
    // pod-runs each, 90 degree steps on blocks at 13.1 V:
    //
    //     steady-state error   3.23 -> 0.96 deg mean,  7.24 -> 2.52 deg max
    //     error sign changes   2.35 -> 0.85 per step
    //     post-settle p-p      0.53 -> 0.21 deg mean, 0.45 max
    //
    // kD chosen at n=60 pod-runs against three rivals, randomised, 12.87-12.95 V. Selection was
    // lexicographic: zero loose-mode runs first, then lowest residual. kD 0.022 was the only one
    // of four to hold 0/60 (true rate bounded below 6%); kD 0.020, 0.014 and 0.010 drew 3, 1 and 1.
    // At kD 0.022: residual at t=3 s 0.77 deg mean / 2.36 max, settle to +/-2.0 deg 0.647 s with
    // 97% of pods settling, post-settle p-p 1.24 max. Per pod the residual is 0.76 / 0.73 / 1.06 /
    // 0.52 deg, so it is a broad distribution rather than one bad pod - 35% of pod-runs exceed
    // 1.0 deg and 12% exceed 1.5 deg.
    //
    // What was actually wrong, in order of size:
    //
    // 1. Loop rate. The turn PID runs at the OpMode loop rate, which was 33 Hz under a four-pod
    //    hold - slower than the servos' own 20 ms PWM frame. Raising it to ~100 Hz cut error sign
    //    changes from 1-4 to 0-1 with the gains untouched. DriveTeleOp was 30.7 Hz and is now
    //    75.8 Hz; see that file. This was the single biggest lever and it is not a gain.
    //
    // 2. kF is a relay, not a feed-forward. CoaxialPod feeds the PIDF a sign, so the F term is
    //    +/-kF. Measured breakaway is 0.025-0.050, so the shipped kF of 0.005 was 5-10x too small
    //    to do anything, and the pod parked where kP*e fell under breakaway: 0.035/0.300 = 6.7 deg.
    //    Setting kF to breakaway does fix the residual (3.52 -> 1.25 deg) and limit-cycles at
    //    42.5 deg peak-to-peak. Replaced by kS, a continuous tanh static-friction term with the
    //    same authority away from the target and no switching discontinuity at it. kF is now 0.
    //
    // 3. servoCachingThreshold 0.05 was wider than the entire breakaway range, so a settled pod's
    //    written power was frozen across a ~19 degree error window. Now 0.01; below that the extra
    //    bus traffic costs loop rate (96 -> 77 Hz) for no measurable gain.
    //
    // Negative results, all measured, so nobody repeats them:
    //
    //   - Encoder noise is NOT why kD misbehaves. Noise floor is sigma 0.042-0.054 deg against a
    //     0.1125 deg read granularity, which pushes 0.0006 of output through kD 0.010. The old
    //     "kD above 0.010 adds ringing" note was a loop-rate artefact.
    //   - Derivative-on-measurement does not permit more damping. Implemented and available
    //     (default off); kD 0.040 rings 16x, 0.070 and 0.110 are unusable.
    //   - Widening the servo PWM pulse range 600-2400 -> 500-2500 us does nothing. The servo
    //     already reaches ~90% of top speed at 0.3 power, so the extra range is never used.
    //   - No measurable backlash. Approaching one heading from both sides 8 times each, the
    //     directional gap is 0.01-0.60 deg and no pod's gap exceeds twice its standard error.
    //   - No mechanical outlier pod. Loose-mode rate is 12.8/17.4/18.2/20.7 percent across the
    //     four, statistically one band.
    //   - kI is still 0, but the old "30-45 degrees of hunting" result is not why. That predates
    //     both the caching fix and PIDFController's integral band and reset threshold. Re-testable.
    //   - Loop rate ABOVE ~48 Hz buys nothing. Randomised interleaved A/B on 2026-08-13, 40
    //     pod-runs per arm, 47.8 Hz against 92.1 Hz with only the dashboard publish rate changed:
    //     steady state 2.65 -> 2.77 deg (95% CI -0.51 to +0.71, p 0.70), err at 3 s 2.80 -> 2.93
    //     (p 0.69), rings 3.95 -> 6.22 (p 0.39), post-settle p-p 0.84 -> 1.02 (p 0.46), rise
    //     10-90% unchanged at 0.37 s. Nothing moved. The servos' own 20 ms PWM frame is ~50 Hz, so
    //     updating faster than that cannot reach them. This does NOT contradict the loop-rate win
    //     recorded above, which was climbing out of ~18 Hz; it bounds where that win stops. It
    //     also kills the tempting story that the residual is "one control period of pod travel" -
    //     per-update travel went 4.5 -> 2.3 deg and the residual did not follow.

    // IMPORTANT, loop rate figures: every rate quoted in this file before 2026-08-13 was computed
    // as the mean of an instantaneous 1/dt column, which overweights short loops and reads ~1.8x
    // optimistic on every trace in tools/swervetune/runs. True throughput is 1/mean(dt). The
    // "33 Hz" and "~100 Hz" above are that inflated statistic; the honest pair is roughly 18 Hz
    // and 50 Hz. The direction and the ranking of the fixes are unaffected - the absolute numbers
    // were wrong. The scorer now records loop_hz_true alongside the old figure.
    //
    // Known not met, off the ground: 90 degree settle to +/-2.0 deg is ~0.5 s against a 350 ms
    // target; residual at t=3 s is 0.54-1.0 deg mean but up to 2.5 deg worst case; pod-to-pod
    // spread is 24-84% against 15%. Roughly 17% of step responses land in a wide mode with 25 deg
    // of peak-to-peak rather than the usual 0.23 deg - that bimodality is gain-controllable and
    // is the open problem. Full trial log and traces in tools/swervetune.

    // Public so the bring-up tool can read them and report any divergence from its own working
    // copy. The tool is supposed to be able to hold different gains - that is what it is for - but
    // it should never be possible to measure at gains nobody intended, which is what happened when
    // its calibration file sat at kD 0.010 while this file said 0.022.
    //
    // PER-POD as of 2026-08-13 evening, indexed by servo number ss0..ss3 like podZeroDeg
    // (0=RB, 1=RF, 2=LF, 3=LB). The pods are not interchangeable plants: re-scoring the day's
    // 534-run kP sweep per pod shows pod 0 carrying the highest residual at every kP while almost
    // never drawing the loose mode (1/159), and pod 3 the lowest residual while drawing it in a
    // quarter of runs at kP 0.320. One shared gain set cannot serve both, which is why criterion
    // 10 (pod-to-pod settle spread) never passed. The scalar turnKP/turnKD/turnKS survive as the
    // pooled-tune values; the factories read the arrays.
    //
    // How the per-pod values were chosen (game tiles, 12.28-12.40 V, randomised interleaved
    // 90-degree steps, n=15-25 per cell per pod, 210 sweep trials total, tools in
    // tools/swervetune/current_runs/perpod_*.jsonl):
    //
    //   The controlling discovery: the wide mode (>=10 deg post-settle excursions) is fuelled by
    //   kS, not tamed by kD. At kS 0.035, kP 0.44 drew 5/25 wide on pod 0; at kS 0.028 the same
    //   kP drew 0/20 wide on pods 0 and 2 and 1/20 on pod 1 - and with the wide mode defuelled,
    //   the extra P authority is free residual: pod 0 |e3| 1.31 -> 0.92, pod 1 0.57 -> 0.49,
    //   pod 2 1.40 -> 0.57 versus their kP 0.320 / kS 0.035 cells. kS below the kinetic need
    //   parks the pod short at low kP (pod 0 at kP .32 / kS .022: 2.84 deg) - the two must move
    //   together.
    //
    //   Pod 3 is the outlier: it draws wide events at EVERY cell tested (kS 0.022-0.050, kP
    //   0.32-0.44), best rate ~7% (1/15) at kS 0.022. Its assignment favours the smallest events
    //   and residual among the tame cells, not zero events, because zero was not on the menu
    //   today. If pod 3's wide mode matters at competition, the fix is mechanical (or the shelved
    //   pulsed/dom experiments), not more gain search on these axes.
    //
    //   Second discovery, and the reason the final values lean conservative: the plant is not
    //   stationary. Pod 0's kS 0.028 cell measured 0/20 wide, then 6/25 wide THIRTY MINUTES
    //   later at the same gains - kinetic friction keeps falling as the pods warm through
    //   sustained testing, so a kS fitted to the friction of the moment goes unstable as the
    //   session runs on. The final choices reduce near-target feed-forward (lower kS, or the
    //   same kS with a wider tanh band) because that direction FAILS SAFE: too little
    //   feed-forward parks a cold pod slightly short; too much feeds the wide mode. Pod 0 takes
    //   the wider band (0/15 wide, 0 wobbles, |e3| 0.79 on the hot plant), pods 1-2 take kS
    //   0.024 (pod 2: 0/15 wide, 0 wobbles), measured per pod, not assumed transferable.

     * 0.035 is the OFF-GROUND breakaway. A carpet re-fit on the competition surface, at
     * competition weight, produced a rival value of 0.045 - measured, not estimated, and the
     * two INVERT between surfaces. Randomised, 10 repeats, n=40 pod-runs per cell, kP 0.200 /
     * kD 0.022 / cache 0.01, 12.5 V:
     *
     *                        kS 0.035                      kS 0.045
     *   game surface   |ss| 2.92 / 7.37 deg           |ss| 1.48 / 4.59 deg
     *                  rings 1.57, p-p max 1.80       rings 2.38, p-p max 3.04
     *   off ground     |ss| 0.56 / 2.22 deg           |ss| 1.23 / 7.26 deg
     *                  rings 1.40, p-p max 9.00       rings 11.43, p-p max 49.31
     *                  1/40 loose                     13/40 loose
     *
     * So 0.045 roughly halves the residual on the surface we actually compete on, and falls
     * apart off the ground. Note the two failures are not the same size: on carpet 0.045's
     * worst peak-to-peak is 3.04 deg, a wiggle; off the ground it is 49 deg.
     *
     * Staying at 0.035 for now, deliberately. A mechanical pass (clean and lubricate the
     * steering path) is planned, and reducing friction moves the plant TOWARD the off-ground
     * condition, which is exactly where 0.045 breaks. 0.035 is the value that holds across the
     * whole friction range measured so far; 0.045 is fitted to the friction the pods have
     * today. Re-fit kS after the mechanical pass and revisit this - if friction ends up low and
     * stable, 0.045 may no longer be the right rival either.
     *
     * Criterion 7 (surface robustness) was written to guard against venue-to-venue variation.
     * That rationale is weaker than assumed: the carpet tested on is the official FTC game
     * surface, the same tiles used at competition. Off-ground robustness is a bench convenience,
     * not an operating condition - it is being weighted here only because of the pending
     * mechanical change.
