 * Loop-rate recorder for all four pods at once.
 *
 * <p>The dashboard's {@code trace} covers one pod and 260 samples, which is enough to eyeball a
 * chart and not enough to score one. The acceptance criteria for pod rotation are written in
 * milliseconds and tenths of a degree - a 200 ms settling time sampled over HTTP at 20 Hz is four
 * points - and {@code pidStepAll} is only trustworthy if all four pods are measured, not just the
 * selected one. So this records every pod every loop into a ring buffer, and renders it as CSV for
 * a host-side scorer to pull once the run is over.
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #add} is called only from the OpMode loop. {@link #toCsv()} is called only from a web
 * worker thread, and only once {@link #recording()} is false - at which point the buffer is no
 * longer written, so the read needs no lock. {@code count} and {@code recording} are volatile so
 * the web thread sees the final values.
